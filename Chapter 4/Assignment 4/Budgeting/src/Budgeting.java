 * @Prompt: Write an interactive application that is supposed to calculate the total amount of monthly expenses and
 * determine whether the user has a healthy spending habit (he/she spends less than earned income per month) or bad
 * spending habits (he/she spends more than earned income per month) based on provide monthly income from the user and
 * inputted expenses.
 * After that display the difference between total monthly spending and total monthly earnings to determine whether
 * the user will have either a positive or a negative amount by the end of the month. In addition, project the statistics
 * to show yearly income vs. yearly spending (based on the monthly amounts respectively). Do not forget to include
 * interactive messages throughout your program as well as creation of objectâ€™s class and respective test class.
 *
 *
 * This class "Budgeting" presents a users with an ability to establish objects with methods of the class itself which
 * includes information like name, expense, and salary.
